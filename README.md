## Run the web app
python webapp.py runserver

you'll need to pip install flask, flask-bootstrap, boto, pandas, etc
will add a requirements.txt file soon!



## Angular App

To run the Angular app (stand-alone), first install dependencies using 'bower install'.

Then, serve the 'public' folder with a webserver. One easy way is with python's SimpleHTTPServer:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
